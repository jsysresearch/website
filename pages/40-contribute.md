# Contribute

JSys is continuously interested in people sharing the journal's vision and willing to contribute to its operation.

We have self-nomination calls open for reviewers and student reviewers. If you are interested in serving as Area Chair (either to help an already-existing one or to help a new one), please [contact the Editors-in-Chiefs](/contact) directly.

-> Links to the open calls here.

- Possibly only one page, with link to self-nomination forms
    - AEB
    - reviewing board (as normal or student member)
    - Chairing (existing or new areas)
