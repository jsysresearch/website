# Contribute

JSys is continuously interested in people sharing the journal's vision and willing to contribute to its operation. 

We regularly open the different JSys roles for self-nomination. Currently open calls are listed below.

- [Artifact Evaluation Board](https://t.co/jY8XmWGHXD)

> If you are interested in serving as Area Chair (either to help an already-existing one or to help a new one), please [contact the Editors-in-Chiefs](/contact) directly.

<!--

- Possibly only one page, with link to self-nomination forms
    - AEB
    - reviewing board (as normal or student member)
    - Chairing (existing or new areas) -->
