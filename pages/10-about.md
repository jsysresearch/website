The Journal of Systems Research (JSys) is a diamond open-access (no fees for authors or readers) journal that seeks to publish research that moves the field forward and will be of interest to the systems community. JSys emphasizes rigorous research that improves the state-of-the-art, even if the increment is modest. JSys requires that papers that put forth a new tool, benchmark, or software solution undergo Artifact Evaluation and make their artifact publicly available.

## Unique features of JSys

Please note that the JSys review process differs from traditional conferences or journals in the systems area. It is closest in spirit to [VLDB](https://www.vldb.org/), but there are some important differences:

### Artifacts must be submitted *along* with the paper

Traditionally, artifact evaluation is optional, and done *after* the paper is accepted. 
At JSys, artifact evaluation proceeds parallely with paper review. 
For Solution and Tool/Benchmark papers, artifact evaluation is mandatory. 

JSys has two submission websites open for papers and artifacts for each deadline. For example, if you are submitting to the Mar 2023 deadline, the paper submission is [here](https://openreview.net/group?id=JSYS/2023/March_Papers), and the artifact submission is [here](https://openreview.net/group?id=JSYS/2023/March_Artifacts). 

### Paper submissions and reviews are publicly visible

Paper review is double-blind and public, while artifact evaluation is single-blind and private.
Artifacts are reviewed privately to allow sharing of sensitive information (e.g., ssh keys).
Some conferences treat paper submissions as confidential until publication; this is not the case at JSys since the submissions are public. 

### All communication happens via comments on OpenReview

JSys uses OpenReview for submission, review, revision, and comments. 
The area chairs and reviewers will communicate with authors via OpenReview comments.
Please ensure that you are able to receive email from the OpenReview system.
