    - student reviewers
    - meta-review and reviewers name
    - instruction for reviewers page?
- Fix the per-area CFP page layout
- Fix weird sizes for lists
- Consider moving the "reviewing process" to info for authors (it's not really a policy)
- [ ] Endogeny to compute and display
    - The proportion of published papers where at least one of the authors is an editor, editorial board member or reviewer must not exceed 20% based on the research content of the latest two issues.
- [ ] Fix table glitch with the TOC
- [ ] Get the latest bib
- [ ] Put together the self-notination forms and finish the "contributing" page.


# About

The Journal of Systems Research (JSys) is a diamond Open Access.  
That is, it is **free to read** and **free to publish** (no fees for authors or readers).

JSys seeks to publish research that moves the field forward and will be of interest to the systems community. JSys emphasizes rigorous research that improves the state-of-the-art, even if the increment is modest. JSys requires that papers that put forth a new tool, benchmark, or software solution undergo Artifact Evaluation and make their artifact publicly available.

<!-- ## Unique features of JSys -->

The JSys editorial process differs from traditional conferences or journals in the systems area. 
It is closest in spirit to [VLDB](https://www.vldb.org/), but there are some important differences worth highlighting.

## Artifacts must be submitted *along* with the paper

Traditionally, artifact evaluation is optional, and done *after* the paper is accepted.
At JSys, artifact evaluation proceeds in parallel of the paper review.
The artifact evaluation is mandatory for [Solution and Tool/Benchmark papers](/cfp#paper-types).

## Paper submissions and reviews are publicly visible

The paper review is double-blind and **public**.  
Most conferences treat paper submissions as confidential until publication, this is different at JSys. The submissions are public (after the submission deadline) as well as the reviews (once the editorial decision has been made). JSys also publishes the reviewer names together with the papers.

The artifact evaluation is single-blind and **private**.  
Artifacts are reviewed privately to allow sharing of sensitive information (e.g., ssh keys). The artifact evaluation process is typically an active exchange between authors and reviewers, aiming to improve the artifact quality.
