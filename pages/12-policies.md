## Review Process

### Decisions

There are three possible editorial decisions for a paper submitted to JSys: Accept with shepherding, Revise, or Reject.

#### Accept with shepherding
  
The paper can be accepted with minor edits that can be completed within one month. Thus, authors can submit on February 1st, get an acceptance decision by March 15th, and submit the final manuscript by April 15th. The final manuscript will be made immediately available online.

#### Revise

The paper needs work that will take more than one month. The authors can submit a revised version anytime in the next three months. A revision submitted on the 1st of a month will get a response by the 1st of the next month.
If authors submitted on March 1st, and got a Revise decision on April 15th, they can submit by Jul 15th and get a final decision by Aug 15th. 

A revision is a contract between the authors and the reviewers: as long as the authors complete the requested changes in good faith by the deadline, the paper will be accepted after a quick review. 

However, the editors reserve the right to reject the paper if additional evidence indicates that the central hypothesis or result of the paper no longer holds.
  
The revised manuscript is submitted using the same OpenReview forum used for the initial submission; use the "Revision" button to submit the revision, which must contain two parts:

- A revision plan explaining the changes made, and how they address reviewer concerns;
- The revised manuscript with changes highlighted for easy reviewing.

#### Reject

The paper needs more than three months of work to be accepted to JSys. The authors cannot submit the same work for one year to JSys.
A rejection decision usually stems from a fundamental mismatch between the work and the journal such as the work is too narrow or out-of-scope. Rejection decisions imply that, even with more experiments or revised writing (that can happen in three months), the paper would not be acceptable for the journal.

We hope to reduce the number of rejection decisions by being clear about what would be acceptable for the journal.


### Contemporary Work

Any peer-reviewed work that was published (PDF available on the publisher’s website) less than two months prior to the initial submission is considered contemporary with the submission. Reviewers will not penalize the submission for not comparing with contemporary work. However, reviewers may ask for a qualitative comparison to be added in the final version of the submitted work.

### Return without Review

For every paper submitted to JSys, the Editors-in-Chief and Area Chairs will try to find expert reviewers. If they are unsuccessful, or if the relevant Editorial Board members already have been assigned their maximum load for the deadline, the paper will be returned to the authors without review (usually within a week or so).
Authors will be invited to resubmit to the next deadline, in which case their work will be reviewed in priority.

We believe this is a preferable outcome than overloading reviewers (thereby lowering the quality of reviews for everyone) or having paper reviewed by non-expert in a paper's topic. We aim to tailor the editorial board size and expertise to prevent this situation from happening as much as possible.


## Open Access Policy

Todo

- [ ] Link to the CC license (not only mention it)
- [ ] Write that the journal meets the DOAJ definition of open access

JSys applies the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) license to all works it publishes.

![CC BY-NC badge](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-nc/2.0/jp/88x31.png)

Under the CC BY-NC license, authors retain ownership of the
copyright for their work, but authors allow anyone to download, reuse,
reprint, modify, distribute, and/or copy articles in JSys, so
long as the original authors and source are cited, and the material is not used for commercial purposes. No permission is required from the authors nor the publisher.

## Rights and Permissions

JSys does not require copyright transfer, only a non-exclusive permission to publish and archive the article. 

Copyright holders retain copyright ownership, granting a non-exclusive license to the JSys and eScholarship to publish the article, meaning that the author may also publish it elsewhere. Before submitting an article to the journal, please be sure that all necessary permissions have been cleared in any third party material. All articles published in JSys are subject to the [journal’s author agreement](https://github.com/jsysresearch/community/blob/main/agreement.pdf).

## Publishing Schedule

Todo 

- [ ] Ensure there is a publication schedule listed – if on a rolling basis, indicate so.
  - Volume: one per year.
  - Papers immediately accessible upon acceptance

## Prices

JSys does not charge any APCs or submission charges. It is completely free for the authors to publish their work in the journal.


## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is a serious form of dishonesty and fraud. Alike most scientific journals, JSys prohibits plagiarism and may take action against authors who commit them.

That being said, we trust our authors' ethical behavior: JSys does not use any plagiarism checking system, until proven necessary.

## Removal and Revision

Once published, an article cannot generally be revised or removed.

We believe it is important to provide perpetual access to materials published whenever possible and appropriate. However, we will remove publications under special circumstances, including in the case of submission errors, rights violations, or inappropriate content. Please be aware, however, that even after the removal of a work, a citation to the work will remain in our system, along with a URL.

If you would like your work removed from JSys, please [contact the editors](/contact/).

Once articles are published, we are generally unable to revise them. 

If a significant error or omission is discovered, please [contact the editors](/contact).

## Long-term Preservation Policy

All materials submitted to JSys are automatically deposited in CDL's [Merritt Preservation Repository](http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/merritt/) for long-term preservation.

## Advertising

JSys allows authors to advertise their work under submission as long as minimal precautions are taken to not blatantly violate double-blind reviewing. Refer to the [Instructions for Authors](/instructions#advertising) for details.
