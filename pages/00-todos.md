## Pre-merge TODOs

- [x] Fix the per-area CFP page layout
- [-] Fix weird sizes for lists
    - Hafl-way solved: the issue is that p and il item sizes are defined proportionaly to the parent. So if they are nested, they get scalled multiple times and get smaller and smaller.
    - I should be able to fix this by tweeking the css, but it works okay as is for now.
- [ ] Get the latest bib
- [ ] Put together the self-notination forms and finish the "contributing" page.

## TODO

- Polish the bibliograhy
- missing somewhere:
    - student reviewers
    - meta-review and reviewers name
    - instruction for reviewers page?
- Consider moving the "reviewing process" to info for authors (it's not really a policy)
- [ ] Endogeny to compute and display
    - The proportion of published papers where at least one of the authors is an editor, editorial board member or reviewer must not exceed 20% based on the research content of the latest two issues.
- [ ] Fix table glitch with the TOC
- [ ] add the new assistants
- [ ] Uddate the area data
