# Contact

TODO

- The contact details must include a contact name and the journal's dedicated email address
- The country in the application and on the journal website must be	the country where the publisher is registered and carries out its	business activities
- a physical mailing address is required to be listed on the journal website (if the journal has no business address, the department of an EIC may be a good alternative to list).
- In addition, those principles state, “Information about the
**ownership and management** of a journal should be clearly indicated on
the journal's website.”
    - Not sure what to say as “ownership” but I guess I can find something sensible…

For any question about the journal:
